       <h4> Beth has just lost her husband Owen to suicide. Devastated, she spends her nights drinking and going through Owen's belongings. She tries to appear stable and in control, but her friend Claire and neighbour Mel are concerned for her. Owen's ominous suicide note‚Äî"You were right. There is nothing. Nothing is after you. You're safe now."‚Äîperplexes her. She begins to suffer from strange supernatural events at night and finds a strange reversed floor plan for their house.

        One night, she discovers a photo on his phone of a woman who looks similar to her, and suspects Owen was having an affair. After a night out with Claire, a drunken Beth reveals that she had been clinically dead for four minutes after a car accident years ago and saw that there was nothing when she died. Owen had always disagreed with this and was close to changing her mind before he died. Beth says that when she suffered from depression a year ago, Owen began sleepwalking, and she thought she had passed her negative emotions to him. That night, she is awakened by a supernatural presence and witnesses several frightened women fleeing through the woods and jumping into the lake. She finds blood on the boat where Owen shot himself and feels an invisible presence.
        
        Crossing the lake to investigate a strange set of lights, she discovers a reversed copy of her house and sees ghostly figures of women with Owen. She passes out and awakens in her own house. She looks for the reversed house again and finds it, although this time it is unfinished and empty. She retrieves a strange statue from it and confronts Mel, who claims he never saw the house but once saw Owen in the woods at night with a woman who looked like Beth. Searching Owen's laptop, she finds more photos of women who look similar to her, identifies the statue from one of his books as an occult voodoo doll, and determines that Owen was trying to learn how to trick and trap demonic entities.
        
        Beth finds the bookstore where Owen bought the books and encounters Madelyne, one of the women from Owen's photos, who denies sleeping with him. Beth visits Claire who asks her to spend a few days away from the house. She agrees and heads home to pack, where she threatens the ghost in the house. Madelyne arrives and tells Beth how Owen invited her to the reverse house. When Owen kissed her, he attempted to choke her, but apologized after she panicked and drove her back home. A drunk Beth visits the reverse house, and under the floorboards finds the bodies of the women Owen had photographed.
        
        An invisible force caresses Beth and she hugs it, mistaking it for Owen's spirit. The spirit reveals that it is not Owen and shows her visions of Owen attacking and murdering the women. The entity drags her through the house, reveals that it is what Beth saw when she died in the car accident, and identifies itself as "Nothing". It explains that it tried to convince Owen to kill Beth to bring her back to the afterlife, but he resisted. Instead, Owen built the reverse house and murdered the Beth-lookalikes to try to trick Nothing, but Nothing realized the trick. It then traps Beth in a position like the statue that she had retrieved from the reverse house earlier.    </h4>

<h1>THE NIGHT HOUSE SONG</h1>
<pre>
   <h2>Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive.
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights.
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the night. Gimme the night.

You need the evening action,
A place to dine, a glass of wine,
A little late romance.
It's a chain reaction.
You'll see the people of the world
Coming out to dance.
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the night. Gimme the night.

So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise.
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that
Starlight look in your eyes.
Don't you know we can fly?
Just gimme the night. Gimme the night.<hr>
